# React dApp Starter Template with Vite, TypeScript, SASS, Ethers, and Wagmi

Welcome to the React dApp Starter Template! This template is designed to help you kickstart your decentralized application (dApp) development journey using a modern stack of technologies. By utilizing Vite, TypeScript, SASS, Ethers, and Wagmi, you'll have a solid foundation to build upon and create innovative blockchain-powered applications.

## Features

- **Vite**: A fast and efficient development build tool that offers lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) for an optimized development experience.
- **TypeScript**: Build your dApp with the benefits of static typing, improving code quality and reducing runtime errors.
- **SASS**: Utilize the power of SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) to create modular and maintainable styles for your dApp.
- **Ethers**: Interact with Ethereum blockchain smart contracts seamlessly using the Ethers library, enabling efficient communication between your dApp and the Ethereum network.
- **Wagmi**: wagmi is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with Ethereum. wagmi makes it easy to "Connect Wallet,"

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your dApp up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Svetoslavb04/react-ts-dapp-template.git`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.

3. **Configure Wagmi**: In the `src/contexts` directory, you'll find a `WagmiProvider.tsx` file where you can configure your Ethereum provider and network settings.

4. **Develop Locally**: Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the development server. This will launch your dApp in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the code will trigger live updates thanks to Vite's HMR.

5. **Build for Production**: When your dApp is ready for production, create an optimized build by running `npm run build` or `yarn build`. The optimized assets will be generated in the `dist` directory.

6. **Deploy**: Deploy your dApp to your preferred hosting platform, ensuring compatibility with Ethereum networks and smart contract interactions.
